The backend of the Portfolio site serves to assist login and permissions on my portfolio site. It allows users to create accounts, login and request permissions to see restricted areas on the site that are otherwise invisible unless approved.

### Motivation & what was learned

The backend was created to reapply what I learned during the [Serverless-Stack](https://serverless-stack.com/) course. I enjoyed working with AWS during this course and wanted to continue growing my knowledge with this technology. I learned quite a lot about AWS and their offerings. In particular Lambda and Cognito. I feel they are well established tools, however from the outset them seem more difficult to pickup compared to their competitor Google and the API's they offer such as Firebase.
